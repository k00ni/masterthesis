Mashup. Additionally, it introduces you to the DataCube vocabulary and how to interpret it. The main part of this work
is devided in two parts: a model about merging datasets and an introduction about modifications and extensions for the
component [CubeViz](http://aksw.org/Projects/CubeViz.html). The model describes on which levels and under circumstances
to merge datasets. Afterwards a comprehensive description of extensions and adaptions on CubeViz takes place. The purpose 
of the modifications on CubeViz was to improve it to help you explore and compare datasets.
